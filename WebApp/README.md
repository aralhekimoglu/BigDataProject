# WebApp

Javascript and CSS files to create a webapp will be stored here. We will have two inputs from the user, a keyword to look for and a source site to look in. Our webapp should show the user output of our sentiment analysis algorithm.

## TODO

- Write a simple HTML form to take input from the user. Output of that form should be redirected to the corresponding Function.
- After function returns a result, display the result to the user.
